I have always been fascinated by probability and statistics ever since I was in high school. I have taken a few courses in probability from school and online courses. But I would say that Joe's probability course is one of my favorite courses of all time! It helped me gasp a deeper understanding in distribution and conditional probability. It also helped me connect the dots between different distributions and their applications.

Early this year, I have been watching the videos of STAT 110 Probability by Professor Joe Blitzstein on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo) for 3 times. I almost listened to it before I went to bed every night! 

This course also served as a pre-requisite and provide a solid foundation for another stat course I took later in Spring 2018: STAT 171 Introductions to Stochastics Processes by [Natesh Pillai](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~pillai/) (I also recommend this course!)

If you want to learn more about random variables and their distributions, conditional probability and a lot of other interesting stuffs related to probability, don't forget to check out STAT 110 at [the course website](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110). There are a lot of study materials and exercise that you could learn and practice too.


Here is some videos that I like the most (if you want to get a quick gasp of what this course is about and why is this course interesting)

- The "two envelope paradox". Starting from 46:20 on [Lecture 25](https://youtu.be/2LR5JYbhyjg?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo&t=2776) to the first part of [Lecture 26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgawcWisb0I&list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo&index=26)


I would like to share one more thing quoted from Joe's in his [talk on "The Soul of Statistics"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=dzFf3r1yph8) (In case you haven't seen this video above. Here is a spoiler alert!)


*"Conditional is the soul of statistics."*




<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **P.S.**  I recently heard from Joe's [twitter](https://twitter.com/stat110/status/557630060895932417) that "He is working on developing an edX version of Stat 110, and that will indeed have a certificate of completion." Hopefully the course will be launching on EdX soon!

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Update 2018:** 
I audited STAT 210 Probability in Fall 2018, a advance version of STAT 110 and it touched on more measure theory and proofs.

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Update 2019:** 
Joe's Introduction to Probability course launched on Edx! Check the course official website [here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-probability) for more! The second edition of Joe's probability book with Jessica Hwang is free online [here](http://probabilitybook.net).
